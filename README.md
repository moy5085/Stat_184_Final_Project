# Stat_184_Final_Project

For my Final Project, I chose to work with the NHL Game Data.

My R script has been uploaded and is available.

There is a folder, named 'Files_Created', which includes the 3 plots and the csv file created in the script.

There is another folder, named 'Data', which includes the data from the Kaggle page I used to do the project. It includes a link to the page.
